Smart Greenify Device Project


Project Concept: Smart Greenify is a device that helps indoor plants to survive without much effort from the owner. 
The device has sensors to detect the water level, humidity, and temperature, and all these parameters can be controlled by the particular plant’s requirement. Grow lights will be used to give artificial sunlight to the plants. We will have a log of data of the different varieties of plant species and their requirements stored in the memory. All the data and controls can be accessed on a handheld device wirelessly over Bluetooth. We also will have a camera to monitor the Plant’s health.

Image Processing is embedded in the main system since the camera will pick up any weird spots and color changes on the leaves of the plants, then analyze them with a library then notify the user.

Do indoor planting benefit in anyways? 

Some general reasons that confirm this is given as follows:

Benefits of growing plants indoors:

Air: Plants contribute to a cleaner, healthier air for us, hence giving us a better living environment, according to NASA research (NASA, n.d.)

Humidity: One of the studies (Lohr, 2010, 2) states that foliage plants can increase the relative humidity to healthier and more comfortable levels in interior spaces

Dust: Adding plants into the room will reduce dust by at least 20% (Lohr, 2010, 2). A study shows that when the plants were in self-watering containers that watered the plants from below, the growing medium surface was dehydrated and dusty. Documenting that interior plants were associated with reduced dust under such circumstances was especially important because it allayed that the ever-increasing medium in containers might make interiors dustier.

Moreover, it has psychological benefits too!

Stress: Interior plants have been associated with reduced stress, increased pain tolerance, and improved people’s productivity. A study showing that when people are in a room with a few containerized interior plants, even when their attention is not drawn to the plants

Feeling: In a study of people working on computer tasks, there were significant differences in the item "I feel attentive or concentrating" (Lohr et al., 1996). When foliage plants were in the room, people reported feeling more attentive than did people in the room without plants.

Productivity: Productivity is higher when plants are present—the computer task study mentioned above. People responded significantly more quickly when plants were in the room than when the plants were absent, and there was no increase in error rate associated with the faster response (Lohr, 2010, 3).
