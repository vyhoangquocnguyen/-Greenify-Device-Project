Smart Greenify Device Project
Project Concept: Smart Greenify is a device that helps indoor plants to survive without much effort from the owner. 
The device has sensors to detect the water level, humidity, and temperature, and all these parameters can be controlled by the particular plant’s requirement. Grow lights will be used to give artificial sunlight to the plants. We will have a log of data of the different varieties of plant species and their requirements stored in the memory. All the data and controls can be accessed on a handheld device wirelessly over Bluetooth. We also will have a camera to monitor the Plant’s health.
Image Processing is embedded in the main system since the camera will pick up any weird spots and color changes on the leaves of the plants, then analyze them with a library then notify the user.
