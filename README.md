# CapstoneProject_G1 - Smart-Greenify- Device

## Project Concept: Smart Greenify is a device that helps indoor plants to survive without much effort from the owner. 
The device has sensors to detect the water level, humidity, and temperature, and all these parameters can be controlled by the particular plant’s requirement. Grow lights will be used to give artificial sunlight to the plants. We will have a log of data of the different varieties of plant species and their requirements stored in the memory. All the data and controls can be accessed on a handheld device wirelessly over Bluetooth. We also will have a camera to monitor the Plant’s health.
Image Processing is embedded in the main system since the camera will pick up any weird spots and color changes on the leaves of the plants, then analyze them with a library then notify the user.

## Features
- **Smartphone control:** the device can be monitored and controlled via the BLE system or by smartphone via Wifi and Google Cloud.
- **Auto-adjusting temperature:** with an optional enclosed space, the temperature in each slot of the device can be adjusted to a suitable level for any particular plant.
- **Auto-adjusting humidity:** some plants may enjoy their habitat in a humid environment; our device can replicate the humidifier system’s moist air humidifier system’s moist air-control.  
- **Auto-watering:** the plants will never be dried out again with this feature; the device will detect the soil’s humidity and automatically water your plants whenever they need.
- **Auto-disease-detect:** the device will have a camera system that scans the leaves of your plants, then detects any disease happening to the plants, and recommends proper treatment.
- **Light system:** with the LEDs system, the device can save up to 70% of power consumption. 
- **Music player:** yes, our device will also have a music function. You wonder why? According to a study, music increases plants’ productivity, and it improves their health and “mood.” (Mazlan, 2020).
- **Friendly control interface:** With a touch screen built on, you can easily control your whole garden within a few steps.
